# Cpp-in-Pascal-Version
 A similarity between C++ and Pascal <br />

**Note:** <br />
Since I’m busy now, so I’ve just pre-uploaded this file. I’ll soon update all and test if it works. For now, only `cpp_pascal.pas` file has been tested and worked, so if you want to learn and run that file just download the file and use Free Pascal to open it :) <br /><br />
